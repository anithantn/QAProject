# QAProject

This is a test of directspecials.com using selenium webdriver.
Instructions
The resources folder includes all the necessary drivers and setup to run the tests. This folder includes jar files for selenium, sts-bundle (platform) to execute the scripts, JDK for java, Firefox setup & drivers for chrome, Mozilla & IE.
I used Spring Tool Suite 3.8.2.Release which is compatible with Selenium 2.53.1 and Mozilla Firefox 47.0.2.
I am including all the setups of the above mentioned software that needs to be installed for executing the scripts.
Approach
I performed an extensive test of directspecials.com using both manual and automation. The testing went pretty smoothly for the most part, however I found some errors listed below along with the screen shots.
Screenshot1 : User input gets appended to the Textbox Label.
Screenshot2 : Phone, Alt Phone and ZIP accepts characters/alphabets.
Screenshot3 : With the wrong inputs in Call Now form, pressing the ‘contact me’ button gives the ‘Thank You’ screen instead of an error.
Screenshot4 : The last name accepts numbers with an approved green tick mark in directtv.com/dtvapp/register/register.jsp
Screenshot5 : Scroll bar is missing when the page is minimized.
